DON JUAN
Oh! Stop thinking about all the bad things that might happen; let’s think only about what
can give us pleasure. The young woman I’ve told you about is a newlywed, the loveliest
in the world, and came here with the man that she’s just married. By an act of chance I
saw these lovers three or four hours before their voyage, and I have never before seen
two people happier with each other or so bursting with love. The visible tenderness of
their mutual ardors moved me; heart-struck, my love was born out of jealousy. Unable to
bear seeing them so happy together, spite further aroused my desires, and I started
delighting in devising ways to trouble this union which so tangibly offended the delicacy
of my heart; until now my efforts have been of no use, but now I am about to resort to the
last remedy. This so-called husband plans to regale his mistress today with a walk by the
sea. Without telling you the details, everything has been readied to satisfy my love, and I
have a small boat and some men, and the beauty will be abducted.
